## Project Description üìù

Shorty API is a lightweight and efficient URL shortening service built with Ruby and the Sinatra framework. This API provides a simple and straightforward way to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.  It addresses the common problem of cumbersome URLs that are difficult to share and track, especially in contexts like social media, email marketing, or presentations.

The API exposes endpoints for creating shortened URLs from long ones and for redirecting users from the shortened URL to the original destination.  The data, consisting of the mapping between short URLs and their corresponding long URLs, is stored in a plain JSON file (`urls.db`), making the service easy to set up and deploy without the need for a complex database system.  This design choice emphasizes simplicity and portability.

Shorty API is ideal for developers and small businesses who need a simple, self-hosted URL shortening solution without the overhead of managing a full-fledged database.  It's also a great learning project for understanding the fundamentals of web API development with Ruby and Sinatra. The lack of an explicit license means the code is likely not free for commercial use - this aspect should be clarified with the owner.

## Key Features ‚ú®

*   **URL Shortening:** Converts long URLs into shorter, more shareable links.
*   **Redirection:** Redirects users from the shortened URL to the original URL seamlessly.
